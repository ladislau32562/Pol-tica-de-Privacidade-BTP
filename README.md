Privacy Policy — Pointage BTP

Effective date: September 17, 2025

This Privacy Policy explains how the mobile application Pointage BTP (“the App”) handles user data in accordance with Google Play policies.

1. Data Collected

The App only stores information manually entered by the user:

Work date

Status (pending/approved)

Supervisor name

Worksite location

Notes

Overtime hours

Day/night shift

Hammer drill bonus ("Prime Marteau Piqueur")

No other personal or sensitive information is collected.

2. Data Storage

All data is stored locally on the user’s device in a private SQLite database.

The App does not send, share, or upload any data to external servers or third parties.

When the App is uninstalled, all stored data is permanently removed from the device.

3. Data Use

The collected data is used exclusively for the main functionality of the App:

To register daily work records.

To calculate overtime and bonuses.

To generate summaries of hours worked.

The App does not use the data for advertising, analytics, or profiling.

4. Sharing with Third Parties

The App does not share data with third parties under any circumstances.

No data is sold, transferred, or disclosed to advertisers, analytics services, or external partners.

5. Permissions

The App does not request access to sensitive permissions such as contacts, location, microphone, or camera.

If, in the future, additional features require permissions (e.g., file storage for exporting reports), the user will be informed and asked for explicit consent before activation.

6. User Rights

Users have full control over their data:

Records can be created, edited, or deleted at any time within the App.

Uninstalling the App permanently removes all stored data.

7. Security

Since all data is stored locally, security depends on the user’s device.

Users are encouraged to protect their device with PIN, password, or biometric authentication.

The App itself does not transmit or expose data externally.

8. Children’s Privacy

The App is designed for use by adults in a professional work context (construction/BTP).

The App does not target children and does not knowingly collect any data from children under 13.

9. Changes to This Policy

This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time.
The most recent version will always be available at the provided link.
